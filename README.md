# predicting-hotel-cancellations
Final report for a university project for which I applied a multitude of Classifiers to predict hotel guest cancellations that support the formulation of overbooking strategies. This entailed thorough preprocessing work, from checking integrity contraints of data to systematically imputing missing values and outliers, and additional efforts for feature engineering, scaling and selection, after which I trained an array of classifiers.

## 1. Languages/technologies used
- Python (pandas, numpy, plotnine)
- Scikit learn for ML modeling

## 2. Algorithms employed
- Ensemble Learners: Bagging Classifier, Boosting Classifier, Stacking Classifier, Random Forest
- Neural Networks: Multilayer Perceptron
- Base Learners: kNN Algorithm, Decision Tree, Logistic Regressor

## 3. Additional methods employed
- Recursive Feature Elimiation
- Various hypothesis tests (e.g. Jarque-Bera, Two-Sample Permutation)
- Redundancy, Variation & Discrimination Analysis
